🌍 CO₂ Emission Prediction ProjectThis project focuses on the rigorous data preparation and feature engineering required to build a robust machine learning model for predicting annual $CO_2$ emissions (in tonnes) from the provided panel data (country $\times$ year time series).🎯 GoalTo prepare the $\mathbf{CO_2}$ emission dataset for machine learning by explicitly addressing three critical challenges inherent to this data type: time dependency, data skewness, and entity imbalance.✨ Key Methodology HighlightsThe data pipeline was designed to transform the raw data into a format optimal for high-performance regression models (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost), focusing entirely on feature engineering and target variable transformation.ChallengeSolution ImplementedRationaleTime Series Aspect (Panel Data)Lagged FeaturesGives the model "memory" of past emissions, essential for time-aware predictions.Skewed Distribution ($CO_2$ Target)$\log(1+x)$ TransformationNormalizes the target variable, mitigating the disproportionate influence of a few large emitters.Entity Imbalance (Country-Specific)One-Hot Encoding (Country)Creates a distinct feature for every country, allowing the model to learn entity-specific trends.🛠️ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering PipelineThe process started with the uploaded co2_emission.csv file and performed the following steps:1. Data CleaningEntity Filtering: Aggregated non-country entities (e.g., 'World', 'Africa', 'G20', etc.) were removed to ensure the analysis focused solely on country-level data.Target Cleaning: Rows with missing or non-positive target values ($\mathbf{CO_2}$ emissions) were removed, specifically dropping 40 rows with negative values to enable the required logarithmic transformation.2. Time-Series Feature EngineeringTwo powerful time-series features were created for each country to capture its historical trend and rate of change:Historical_Avg_CO2 (Trend): The expanding mean of all previous years' $CO_2$ emissions for that country. This acts as a rolling baseline.CO2_Change (Momentum): The year-over-year difference in $CO_2$ emissions for that country ($\text{Current Year} - \text{Previous Year}$).3. Target Variable TransformationTo address the severe skewness in the Annual CO₂ emissions (tonnes ) column:The raw target variable, $\mathbf{Y}$, was transformed using the $\log(1+x)$ function to create the new target: $\mathbf{Y}' = \log(1+\mathbf{Y})$. This resulting variable has a more Gaussian distribution, which improves the performance of standard machine learning algorithms.4. Final Data PreparationFeature Scaling: Numeric features (Year, Historical_Avg_CO2, CO2_Change) were standardized using StandardScaler.Categorical Encoding: The Country column was converted into binary features using OneHotEncoder (creating $\sim 200$ new features).Train/Test Split: The final feature matrix ($\mathbf{X}$) and transformed target vector ($\mathbf{Y}'$) were split into $80\%$ Training and $20\%$ Testing sets, ready for the modeling stage.
